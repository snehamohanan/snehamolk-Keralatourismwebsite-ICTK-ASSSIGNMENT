The hilly district of Malappuram falls among the northern districts in the state of Kerala. Closely bordered by the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats on its east, and flanked by the Arabian Sea on the West, Malappuram has an eventful history with the Zamorins of Kozhikode ruling the region for a significant period in the past. The district has also witnessed several local uprisings against the British rule, and was once a prominent center for Hindu-Vedic learning and Islamic philosophy. Historic monuments, natural attractions, ritual art forms, ethnic cuisine and age-old traditions make Malappuram a unique destination for travelers.

<p>
<br> The Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary or the Kadalundi Nagaram, is definitely one of the best places to visit in Malappuram. It sits right at the spot where River Kadalundi Puzha flows into the Arabian Sea.Easily accessible from Malappuram and Kozhikode, the bird sanctuary is host to about 100 species of native birds, and about 60 species of migratory birds. 

This includes Whimbrels, brahminy kites, terns, seagulls, sand plovers, sandpipers, green shanks and turn stones, all of whom appear to their respective seasons.

The River of Bharata, also known as Nila, the Bharathapuzha River is a west-flowing river in the state of Kerala, and is the second longest river in the state. The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures. 

All along the river, there are about 11 dams made to use its waters for the purpose of irrigation. Culturally, the river has an importance in a number of parts of the state, like the famous Kerala Kalamandalam which is housed on the banks of the river.

<br>Another attraction of Malappuram that is often compared to the famous town of Ooty, Kodikuthimala is definitely a sight for the sore eyes. A hill station of Kerala, the place is perched on a height of about 522 m above sea level, and is the highest point in the Amminikkadan hills. 

Once the spot where the Britishers once hoisted their flag, the spot was opened for tourism only a few decades ago, with a large area of the place marked already for future development projects. There is a watch tower on the top of the hill from where tourists can get a panoramic view.

<P><br>     A stretch of jungle near Malappuram, the Nedumkayam is famous for the rich foliage of rain forests. Home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, the dense jungles attract a number of tourists from nearby and around the country, who come here to take some of the most amazing photographs. 

  You can spot  elephants, bison, tiger, rabbit, blue monkey, bear, wildcat and deer while you are on a visit here. The forests here are actually a part of the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. A great attraction here is the wooden rest house in the forest which was built during the colonial era.</P>
