<p>Formerly known as Calicut, Kozhikode is located in Kerala. It was the Capital of Malabar during the Zamorin rule 500 years ago and is famous for its centuries-old trade in cotton and spices with Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians and Chinese. Basking in the idyllic setting of the serene Arabian Sea on the west and the proud peaks of the Wayanad hills on the east, this district with the serene beaches, lush green countryside, historic sites, all combine to make Kozhikode a popular tourist destination.</p>

<p>
<br> Situated near the mouth of Chaliyar river, Beypore beach is a famous tourist destination. Your visit to Kozhikode remains incomplete without a day spent at Beypore beach. There is never a dearth of activities once you are at the beach. Clearly, one of the favourite tourist places to visit in Kozhikode, this beach takes into a different world with its numerous fun-filled activities to keep you engaged as it offers abundant water activities like surfing, sunbathing, water skiing and swimming.

You can take in the vast expanse of rich golden sand, coconut trees that dot the coastline or the stone bridge known as Pulimoodu, which builds a pathway into the sea. There is never a dull moment at the beach and you can pamper yourself in a refreshing Ayurveda massage

Kappad beach, a tranquil setting for a relaxed getaway, is located about 16 km from Kozhikode town. The beach occasionally visited by tourists, is quiet except when the fishermen launch their boats at dawn and in the evening when they return with their catch. Other interesting sights here include a rocky headland that stretches into the sea.

<br><P> Said to be built on the remains of a shipwreck, the Thikkoti Lighthouse is one of the major attractions of Kozhikode. Located on a rocky shoreline, the place is best known for the scenic views it offers as well as several species of nomadic birds.   </P><br>
<p><font color="green" align="center"><h4>Thusharagiri Fall </h4></font></p>

<p><img src="IMAGES\district\kzhkd\thushargiri.jpg" width="50%" height="40%" align="center"></p>
<P><br>     Enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Thusharagiri Fall when you pay a visit to Kozhikode.  Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet at this point to create the Chalipuzzha River. The river further trifurcates to create three waterfalls and the free-falling water creates a mist, thus giving the name “Thusharagiri”.

  This place has a lovely view all around and you get plenty of activities to indulge in. You may go for trekking, or enjoy rock-climbing.
