Alappuzha is referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine products and coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier, which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the attraction of the beach. There is also an old lighthouse nearby which greatly intrigues all visitors.

Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices. 

Of late, houseboats come equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel room including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters can be enjoyed while staying in a houseboat..

<br> This is one of the most beautiful Alappuzha tourist places that you absolutely cannot miss. Vembanad Lake is Kerala’s longest lake and is also among the largest in India. Several canals empty their water into the lake at several points along its wide expanse. Since it is a long lake, it covers many districts of Kerala and goes by different names in each district like Punnamada Lake in Kuttanad, Kochi Lake in Kochi. Many small islands dot its length. 

Boating in this lake is a part of backwater trip in Kerala. The Kumarakom Tourist Village offers houseboat cruises and holiday packages which you can take advantage of and so have the best possible backwater boating experience on your trip. The lake is full of exciting possibilities- just imagine yourself floating on the lake early in the morning, sipping a hot cup of coffee and listening to the gentle lapping of the waves and chirping of birds. Now that is peace and happiness! </p>
