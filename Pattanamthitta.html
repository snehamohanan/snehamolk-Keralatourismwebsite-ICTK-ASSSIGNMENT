Gavi is a carefully-protected natural reserve inhabited by some of the rarest and most elusive animals known to man. That’s why you have to be quiet, and carry your own litter when in Gavi. The local authorities, along with the villagers, go to great lengths to maintain this ecological vault of sorts. Gavi is a great place to go to trekking, but you have to be accompanied by forest officials wherever you go. The way the people treat Mother Nature will create deep respect for Gavi, making it one of the top tourist spots in Pathanamthitta

<P><br>     Konni Elephant Training Center is located near Iravan village between Pathanamthitta and Pathanapuram. It is one of the most prominent elephant training centers in Kerala and among the major tourist places in Pathanamthitta.

  Located in a thick forest environment, this training center was used to train wild elephants. The big wooden cages used to put newly brought wild elephants for training are still an attraction. Locally known as Aanakoodu, they can house up to 3 to 4 elephants at a time.
  
  The primary focus of the trainers here is to deal with the development of baby elephants that have been separated from their herd or been found hurt somewhere. The elephants are taught to obey specific commands and are taken for special exercise walks in the morning, are given baths and specific diets. At Konni, one gets to observe this training procedure in person. The baby elephants love playing with the guests and are especially friendly with children. Bigger elephants are used for rides around the place.</P>
